# Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
##  How to talk to computers
###   Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
In the first session of video lecture, we learnt about a proceessor and its interfaces. The dimensions of the entire processor was 7mm x 7mm. The different types of interfaces include Pads, Core, Die .
The definitions are as follows:
Pads- This Send signal inside to the chip.
Core- It consists of the Logic gates.
Die - It is the size of the entire chip.
the Example given to us for our learning was RISC-V.
